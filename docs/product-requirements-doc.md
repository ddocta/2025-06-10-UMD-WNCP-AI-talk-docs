# AI Resume Builder - Product Requirements Document

## TL;DR

AI Resume Builder is a streamlined single-page web application that transforms LinkedIn profiles into tailored, ATS-optimized resumes specifically designed for Product Managers seeking senior roles at AI/ML companies. Built with Next.js and Shadcn/ui, it leverages Google Gemini AI (free tier) to bridge the gap between traditional PM experience and newly acquired AI skills, enabling users to create compelling resumes in under 2 minutes.

## Goals

- **Solve the core need** of mid-level PMs struggling to showcase AI/ML competencies alongside traditional product skills when applying for senior positions
- **Delight users** by intelligently highlighting relevant experience and newly acquired skills that match specific job requirements
- **Enable rapid iteration** through mobile-first design that allows resume creation during networking events or commutes
- **Build trust** through secure, privacy-first architecture using Supabase for data persistence
- **Create a polished experience** with modern UI components and smooth interactions
- **Focus on outcome quality** over feature quantityâ€”better to nail the core resume generation than add peripheral features

## Non-Goals

- Will not become a full ATS or job application tracking system
- Does not include interview preparation or salary negotiation features in MVP
- Will not support team/enterprise features or shared resume templates initially
- Does not automate job applications or integrate with job boards
- Will not process resumes for non-PM roles in the first release

## Narrative

It's 9 PM. Sarah, a Product Manager at a Series B startup, just got home from an AI/ML meetup where she networked with a recruiter from Anthropic. The recruiter mentioned a Senior PM role opening tomorrow. Sarah's current resume emphasizes her e-commerce experience but barely mentions the ML certification she completed last month or the recommendation engine side project she's been building.

She opens AI Resume Builder on her phone while making tea. No complex signup process - just email and password, and she's in. A quick paste of her LinkedIn profile, followed by the Anthropic job description she found online. She adjusts the dropdowns: 7-9 years experience, High technical depth, Modern style, AI/ML Product Management focus.

The AI immediately identifies that Anthropic values technical depth and suggests emphasizing her SQL skills and A/B testing experience through an ML lens. It pulls her GitHub contributions into a "Technical Leadership" section and reframes her e-commerce personalization work as "ML-driven user experience optimization."

Within 90 seconds, Sarah has a polished resume accessible via a permanent URL. She copies the link and emails it to the recruiter before her tea gets cold. The next morning, she has an interview scheduled.

## Summary & Open Questions

### Executive Summary
AI Resume Builder addresses a critical pain point for mid-level Product Managers seeking senior roles in the competitive AI/ML industry. By leveraging Google Gemini AI to intelligently transform LinkedIn profiles into tailored resumes that emphasize both traditional PM skills and newly acquired technical competencies, we can reduce resume creation time from hours to minutes while significantly improving quality and relevance.

The single-page design with modal authentication ensures users can create compelling resumes anywhere, anytimeâ€”crucial for busy professionals who discover opportunities through networking or spontaneous job postings.

### Key Differentiators
1. **AI-PM Focus**: Unlike generic resume builders, specifically optimized for PMâ†’Senior PM in AI companies
2. **Speed**: 2-minute turnaround vs. 2+ hours manual editing
3. **Free AI**: Uses Google Gemini's free tier - no API costs for users
4. **Simple Access**: No downloads - resumes hosted with permanent URLs
5. **Privacy-First**: User controls their data with Supabase's secure infrastructure

### Open Questions for Refinement

1. **Monetization Strategy**
   - Freemium with limited generations?
   - One-time purchase ($29) vs. subscription ($9/month)?
   - Premium features like custom domains for resume URLs?

2. **AI Integration Depth**
   - Should we auto-generate cover letters too?
   - Include interview question preparation based on resume?
   - Suggest LinkedIn profile optimizations?

3. **Resume URL Strategy**
   - Custom domains for premium users?
   - Analytics on who views resumes?
   - Expiration dates or permanent hosting?

4. **Success Tracking**
   - How do we measure actual job placement success?
   - Should we build in feedback loops from recruiters?
   - Community features for peer review?

5. **Competitive Moat**
   - How do we prevent copying of our AI prompts?
   - Should we build proprietary PM skills taxonomy?
   - Partner with PM communities for distribution?

These questions will guide our iteration strategy post-MVP, ensuring we build what users truly need rather than what we assume they want.
